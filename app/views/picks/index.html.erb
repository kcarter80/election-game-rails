<h1>Election Pool 2014</h1>

<p>
Rules: For those unfamiliar with point spreads, for each pick all you need to do is take an "under" or an "over."  So, for example, if you believe Mitch McConnell will beat Allison Lundergan Grimes in Kentucky by more than the 4-point spread, take the over.  If you think McConnell will win by less than 4 points or that Grimes will win by any margin there, take the under. For every pick made correctly, you get a point. A push or a tie result = half a point for everyone. All final (actual) election results will be rounded to the nearest half-point (0.5), so please take that into account in making picks. The most points at the end wins.
